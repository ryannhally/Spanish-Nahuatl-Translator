# Spanish-Nahuatl Text Translator

Translates text from Spanish into Nahuatl through Google's T5-Small transformer. Trained on SomosNLP's Spanish-Nahuatl dataset consisting of 20,000 pairs. To test different strategies for improving model performance, created six total translaters and compared automatic evaluation metric scores as well as human judgements of produced translations.

Completed for my undergrad comprehensive project.
